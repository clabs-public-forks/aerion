# Aerion Email Client (_Personal Fork_)

## Overview

- This is a personal fork of [Aerion](https://github.com/hkdb/aerion), a cross-platform email client by [hkdb](https://github.com/hkdb). 
- The goal of this project is to turn Aerion into a Beeper-like chat app for email.

**Notes:**

- This fork started as a simple UI customizaton for Aerion, but has diverged greatly since.
- This fork tracks upstream Aerion for now, but it is likely to diverge and may eventually stop tracking it.
- This fork will eventually be renamed and moved to a new Github repo.
- Expect these differences:
  - Upstream release binaries do not include these changes. Build from source to use this fork.
  - Only the English UI is maintained. Other languages may be incomplete or out of date.
  - Report problems with fork features here, not upstream.
