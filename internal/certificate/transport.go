// broker also hands out account-level clients before the DAV host is known).

// BuildTLSConfig for that host, so trust is checked against the exact host the
// request was addressed to. Taking the host from the request rather than from
// the TLS connection state matters for IP-literal hosts: they send no SNI, so
// tls.ConnectionState.ServerName is empty and a pinned certificate could never
