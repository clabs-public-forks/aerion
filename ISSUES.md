# Issues

## Open

Found by the full audit on 2026-10-08. Each entry gives a severity, the
location, and the failure. "Unverified" means a reviewer reported it and it
has not yet been confirmed against the code.

### Security

- **S6 medium** `internal/smime/verifier.go` `verifyChain`: there is no
  revocation check, so a revoked signer still shows as trusted. Needs an
  owner decision: OCSP or CRL fetches on every view tell the CA what is
  being read. (The signing-time half of S6 is fixed.)

### App layer

- **A4 medium** `app/extension_contacts.go:32-52` and contacts backend
  imports: EXT_RULES R1, R2 and R5. The bridge gets a token closure and the
  core DB, and the extension imports `internal/*`. This is architectural
  (see C12).

### Contacts

- **C12 medium** contacts backend: EXT_RULES R1, R2, R5 and R6 (see A4).
  Architectural.

### Calendar

- **C17 low** DAV certificate follow-ups: the setup dialogs now offer the
  certificate-accept prompt, but a certificate that changes on an existing
  CardDAV/CalDAV source's background sync only fails the sync (mail sync
  prompts), and certificates accepted permanently for DAV hosts don't show in
  the account Security tab's trusted-certificate list, which lists mail hosts
  only. Deeper fix: stamp the host on `certificate.Error` in
  `certificate.Transport` and return it structurally from the DAV bindings,
  replacing the frontend's error-string regex and the second `Probe` request
  (which also misses certificates only discovery redirects reach).

### Mail sync

- **M6 low** `app/idle_sent.go`: Sent activity from other clients is
  inferred from inbox IDLE events, so a new (non-reply) message sent
  elsewhere reaches Sent and its chat thread only on the next scheduled
  sync. Deeper fix: IDLE on the Sent folder too (a second connection, or a
  folder set in `internal/imap`'s IDLE) routed to the same incremental sync,
  which would also retire the 30 s throttle state; cheaper: a shorter Sent
  poll interval.

### Upstream independence

This fork may eventually stop tracking upstream Aerion. Until then, some code
is kept or left untouched only to keep upstream merges clean. Record each such
cleanup here, so it can be done once the fork is independent.

- **U1** frontend: delete the unmounted classic `MessageList`,
  `ConversationRow` and `ConversationViewer`, kept only to avoid merge
  conflicts. They hold unshared copies of chat-component logic (the inbox
  lookup, the sync toggle, trash-with-undo) that go with them; the chat
  side uses `accountStore.getFolder`/`getInbox` and
  `components/chat/chatTriage.ts`.
- **U3** non-English locale files: this fork updates English only, so the
  other locales drift. Remove them, or decide to maintain them.

### Dependencies

- **D2 low** `frontend/package.json`: TypeScript is held at 6.0.x.
  TypeScript 7 is blocked by peer ranges: `typescript-eslint` requires
  `<6.1.0` and `svelte-check` requires `^5 || ^6`. Upgrade once both accept 7.
