# Issues

## Open

Found by the full audit on 2026-10-08. Each entry gives a severity, the
location, and the failure. "Unverified" means a reviewer reported it and it
has not yet been confirmed against the code.

### Security

- **S6 medium** `internal/smime/verifier.go` `verifyChain`: there is no
  revocation check, so a revoked signer still shows as trusted. Needs an
  owner decision: OCSP or CRL fetches on every view tell the CA what is
  being read. (The signing-time half of S6 is fixed.)

### App layer

- **A4 medium** `app/extension_contacts.go:32-52` and contacts backend
  imports: EXT_RULES R1, R2 and R5. The bridge gets a token closure and the
  core DB, and the extension imports `internal/*`. This is architectural
  (see C12).

### Contacts

- **C12 medium** contacts backend: EXT_RULES R1, R2, R5 and R6 (see A4).
  Architectural.
