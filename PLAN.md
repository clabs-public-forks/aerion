# PLAN: Mail UI polish — chat list and reading pane

## Scope

Improve visual hierarchy, density, focus visibility and theming in the live
chat-style mail UI (`frontend/src/lib/components/chat/*`, plus
`viewer/EmailBody.svelte` and `viewer/AttachmentList.svelte`, which
`ChatBubble.svelte` renders). Apple Mail on macOS is the reference for
principles, not platform chrome. Keep the Tailwind + theme-token system
(`frontend/src/themes/*.css`, HSL vars like `--primary`, `--muted`) and the
existing kit components. English locale only (`frontend/src/lib/i18n/locales/en.json`).

Out of scope: the classic `list/MessageList`, `list/ConversationRow` and
`viewer/ConversationViewer` components. `App.svelte` mounts `ChatList` and
`ChatView` only; deleting the classic code is ISSUES.md U1.

Baseline (code review; measure heights in DevTools before M1 and M4):

- `ChatRow.svelte` is about 100px with the preview on: people line (20px),
  subject `line-clamp-2 text-xs leading-5 min-h-10` (40px), snippet `truncate
  text-sm` (20px), `py-2.5`. The subject is smaller than the snippet.
  `contain-intrinsic-size` claims 68px.
- Selection is `bg-primary/20` whether or not the list has focus. The listbox
  sets `data-focused` (`ChatList.svelte:426`) but nothing styles it. Hover is
  `hover:bg-muted/60`.
- No `focus-visible` styles in `chat/` except the quote button in
  `ChatBubble.svelte`. The listbox has `outline-hidden`; rows use
  `aria-activedescendant` with `tabindex="-1"`.
- `ChatRow` dates use `formatRelativeDate` (`lib/utils/date.ts`): "just now",
  "5m", "3h" today.
- `ChatListHeader.svelte` has no total/unread counts.
- `ChatSecurityBanners.svelte` hard-codes 28 Tailwind palette colors (the
  `TONES` map and the read-receipt button). `EmailBody.svelte:747–764` has a
  `yellow-*` remote-images banner. Signed and encrypted (positive) states each
  take a full banner.
- Full email bodies sit in a `rounded-xl border` box (`ChatBubble.svelte:229`).
- `ChatView.svelte` is 499 lines, at the 500-line guideline.

Already done in the chat UI, so not planned: grouped toolbar with separators
and an overflow menu (`ChatViewHeader.svelte`), row `aria-label` summary, hover
action buttons with `aria-label`s and keyboard shortcuts.

## Milestones

### M1 — Chat list row and header

1. Row density and hierarchy (`ChatRow.svelte`):
   - Subject on one line (`truncate`, drop `min-h-10`); snippet stays one line.
   - Subject at least the snippet's size, with people > subject > snippet in
     weight or color.
   - Update `contain-intrinsic-size` to the measured height.
2. Hover tint visible on light themes (for example `hover:bg-muted` instead of
   `/60`).
3. Focus visibility: `focus-visible` rings on every `ChatListHeader` button,
   filter chip and the scope trigger. The active row shows a ring or inset
   outline while the listbox has keyboard focus.
4. Dates: add `formatListDate` to `lib/utils/date.ts` (clock time today,
   "Yesterday", weekday within the last 7 days, then the existing `MMM d` /
   `MMM d, yyyy`) and use it in `ChatRow`. Leave `formatRelativeDate` for other
   callers.
5. Header subtitle in `ChatListHeader`: the current folder's
   `totalCount`/`unreadCount` (folder model, kept up to date by
   `accounts.svelte.ts`), with ICU plural keys in `en.json`. For the unified
   inbox, sum the inbox unread counts; hide the subtitle when no counts exist.

Acceptance criteria:

- With the preview on, a standard row measures 72–80px in DevTools; with the
  preview off it is shorter.
- Hover is visible on built-in light and Adwaita light (screenshot).
- Tabbing through the list header shows a ring on each control; arrowing in the
  focused list shows which row is active.
- Rows from today show a clock time (for example "14:05" or "2:05 PM" per
  locale); yesterday shows "Yesterday".
- The subtitle reads, for example, "1,204 messages, 3 unread" and updates when
  messages are read.
- Changed components stay under 500 lines.

Validation:

- `cd frontend && npm run lint && npm run check`.
- `run-aerion` skill: screenshots of the list on built-in (light and dark) and
  Adwaita light; keyboard pass through header and list. If no display is
  available, record that in Progress.

### M2 — Selection follows pane focus

1. Style the selected row from the listbox's `data-focused` (for example a
   `group/list` + `group-data-[focused]/list:` variant), falling back to
   `isPaneFocused('messageList')` (`lib/stores/keyboard.svelte.ts:29`) if the
   attribute does not cover all cases:
   - list focused: solid `bg-primary text-primary-foreground`; subject,
     snippet and time use `text-primary-foreground/80`;
   - list not focused: neutral `bg-muted`.
2. The unread pill, status icons and hover actions stay legible on the solid
   selection (invert the pill).

Acceptance criteria:

- Clicking the reading pane switches the selected row from solid to neutral;
  clicking or keyboard-focusing the list switches it back.
- `--primary-foreground` on `--primary` is at least 4.5:1, and the `/80`
  secondary text is at least 4.5:1, for `_defaults.css` and all 11 themes in
  light and dark.

Validation:

- `npm run lint && npm run check`.
- A scratch script that parses each theme's `--primary`/`--primary-foreground`
  HSL values and computes the contrast ratios (including the 80% blend);
  record the lowest ratio in the Progress entry.
- `run-aerion`: screenshots for built-in, Adwaita, Dracula, Nord and GitHub,
  focused and unfocused. If no display is available, record that in Progress.

### M3 — ChatView extraction (refactor, no behavior change)

1. Move a self-contained part of `ChatView.svelte` (message loading/state or
   keyboard handling) into a `.svelte.ts` module or child component so M4 has
   room.

Acceptance criteria:

- `ChatView.svelte` is at most about 400 lines; every new file is under 500.
- Behavior is unchanged: opening a thread, j/k between messages, reply,
  archive, and the security banners all work as before.

Validation:

- `npm run lint && npm run check`.
- `run-aerion`: walk through the listed behaviors. If no display is available,
  record that in Progress.

### M4 — Reading pane polish

1. Record the baseline (spacing between messages, header height) in this plan
   before changing anything.
2. Full-body messages (`ChatBubble.svelte:229`) drop the bordered box and sit
   on the pane background, separated by a hairline (`border-border`) between
   messages.
3. Per-message actions and the focused-bubble ring use `focus-visible`
   instead of appearing on any focus.
4. `ChatViewHeader`: the subject is the primary heading, with participants
   secondary.

Acceptance criteria:

- Measured spacing matches the values recorded in step 1's target.
- Mouse clicks on a bubble show no ring; keyboard focus does.
- Changed components stay under 500 lines.

Validation:

- `npm run lint && npm run check`.
- `run-aerion`: before/after screenshots of a long HTML thread and a short
  plain-text thread. If no display is available, record that in Progress.

### M5 — Themed status tokens

1. Add `--info`, `--success`, `--warning` and their `-foreground` pairs to
   `themes/_defaults.css` and each theme file, and map them in the `app.css`
   `@theme inline` block.
2. Rewrite the `ChatSecurityBanners` `TONES` map and the read-receipt button,
   and the `EmailBody` remote-images banner, to use the tokens (`bad` uses
   `--destructive`).
3. Positive states (signed, encrypted) become a compact badge in the bubble's
   meta line; failures and warnings stay full banners.
4. Check the token change against `docs/EXT_RULES.md`.

Acceptance criteria:

- `grep -nE '(blue|green|amber|red|yellow)-[0-9]' frontend/src/lib/components/chat/ChatSecurityBanners.svelte frontend/src/lib/components/viewer/EmailBody.svelte`
  prints nothing.
- Banner text on its token background is at least 4.5:1 for all themes in
  light and dark.
- A signed message shows a badge, not a banner; a bad signature still shows a
  banner.

Validation:

- `npm run lint && npm run check`; the grep above.
- The M2 contrast script, extended to the new tokens.
- `run-aerion`: signed, encrypted, bad-signature and remote-images messages on
  three themes. If no display is available, record that in Progress.

## Progress

- [x] M1 — Chat list row and header (visual checks outstanding: dev mode forces Nord Dark on the real mailbox, so row heights, light-theme hover and screenshots need the owner)
- [x] M2 — Selection follows pane focus (contrast verified by script, lowest ratio 4.61 across all 28 theme variants after `_selection.css`; screenshots and the click-to-switch check not done, no display in this session, so the owner needs to check them)
- [x] M3 — ChatView extraction (moved scroll/anchor/message focus to `chatScroll.svelte.ts` and triage actions to `chatActions.svelte.ts`; ChatView 499 → 397 lines; lint and check pass; walkthrough not done, no display in this session)
- [x] M4 — Reading pane polish (full-body messages drop the border box and get a `border-t border-border` hairline unless they start a day (the day separator divides there); ring and per-message actions use `group-focus-visible` / `group-has-focus-visible`, so the unused `focused` prop is gone; header shows subject as `text-base` heading with participants below, sender chats unchanged; lint and check pass; no display in this session, so before/after screenshots and the measured spacing are not done and need the owner)
- [x] M5 — Themed status tokens (`themes/_status.css` defines the six tokens for light and dark via `:root`/`.dark`, mapped in `app.css`; `ChatSecurityBanners` and the `EmailBody` banner use them, grep prints nothing; signed/encrypted are badges in the meta line via new `chatSecurity.ts`; banner text ≥ 5.17:1 on every theme background and card by `/tmp/contrast/status.py`; lint, check and build pass; no display in this session, so the signed/encrypted/bad-signature/remote-images checks on three themes need the owner)

## Surprises & Discoveries

- Sender chats by default: the chat list always takes the window pass over the whole scope now (the `hasSenderChats` shortcut is gone), and pins or snoozes set on single threads before the upgrade are hidden inside their sender's chat until that sender is split. Neither checked on a large real mailbox.
- Visual pass 2026-10-10 (dev server, Nord Dark only, real mailbox; widths 668/900/1100px via an iframe because the Chrome window could not be resized): list, selection switching, header subject, day separators, remote-images banner and card expand look right. Fixed: toolbar and header buttons lacked focus-visible rings (Compose's ring was invisible on primary, now offset); no divider under the reading-pane subject, so scrolled messages clipped flush; `ChatRichCard`'s `block` overrode `line-clamp-3` (16-line preview) and the toggle plus `pr-20` squeezed it to a 162px column. Still unchecked: light themes, signed/encrypted/bad-signature messages (none in the mailbox), measured row heights.

- M5 review: `viewer/ConversationViewer.svelte` (classic, unmounted) still has hard-coded blue/green/amber banners and its own status mapping; left out of scope (ISSUES.md U1). The solid-button pairing (`bg-*-foreground` with `text-background`) is covered by the contrast script rows tagged `btn` (≥ 5.17).
- M3 review found that `_selection.css`'s `:root` rule gave the 7 unlisted themes the light purple instead of the `--primary` fallback; fixed with an explicit reset block there.
- `formatListDate` today branch uses `toLocaleTimeString` (OS locale) and goes stale after midnight; not fixed.
- `contain-intrinsic-size` (80px/60px) is computed from the row layout, not measured.
- `formatListDate` weekday and month names are English (date-fns default), like `formatRelativeDate`.

## Decision Log

- Owner request 2026-10-10: the list header no longer shows the message/unread counts subtitle (M1 item 5 reverted; `chat.listCounts` removed).
- Owner request 2026-10-10: the reading pane's flex basis is 30rem (was 20rem), so the list gives way before the reading pane drops below 480px; before, the list kept 420px while the pane shrank to 320px (checked with a headless Chromium layout of the same CSS).
- Owner request 2026-10-10: sender chats are on by default. Migration 50 adds `sender_chat.combined` (default 1, so earlier opt-ins stay combined); a row now records a per-sender choice and **Show as separate threads** stores 0. Threads started from the account's own addresses (account email and identities) or with no sender stay thread chats, so Sent folders are unaffected. No global setting yet.
- M5: tokens live in one `_status.css` keyed on `:root` / `.dark` rather than in each of the 28 theme blocks (themes may still override them); `-foreground` is the tinted-banner text color, also used as a solid button background with `text-background`. Bad banners use `--destructive` for tint and border with `text-foreground` text, since several themes' destructive reds fail 4.5:1 as text. EXT_RULES.md has no theming rules and no extension code was touched.

- M4 baseline (from code, not measured): group gap `mt-3` (12px), same-sender `mt-0.5`; header block `pt-3 pb-1` with a 32px avatar row and `text-sm` title. Target: same gaps plus `pt-3` and a 1px hairline above full-body groups; header title `text-base`.

- M2: `--primary`/`--primary-foreground` and the 80% text both reach 4.5:1 in only 7 of the 28 theme variants (lowest 2.01, breeze). Rather than retune every theme's primary, which colors buttons everywhere, a new `--selection`/`--selection-foreground` pair (`themes/_selection.css`, falling back to the primary tokens in `app.css`) overrides 21 variants with a shifted lightness and a pure white or black foreground.

- Apple Mail is the reference for principles only. Theme tokens and kit
  components stay; no macOS-specific chrome.
- Target the chat UI: the classic list and viewer are unmounted dead code
  (ISSUES.md U1), so their density, unread-accent and star settings are not
  part of this plan.
- Rows keep a one-line snippet and a one-line subject, targeting 72–80px.
- Refactors get their own milestone (M3) so each milestone is one commit and
  visual diffs stay reviewable.
